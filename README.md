Second homework: Luxo Grandpa (deadline: 5 May)
Luxo Junior has become Luxo Grandpa (LG), so we are dedicating a new beam tracker programme to him. LG stands on a plane, its structure (from bottom to top) is cylinder base, ball joint1, cylinder rod1, ball joint2, cylinder rod2, ball joint3, paraboloid with a point source sitting at the focal point. The ball joints rotate continuously along axes other than the coordinate axes. The actors are illuminated by another point light source and ambient light. The camera rotates around LG. The actors are of diffuse-specular type of lumpy material.

Result:
